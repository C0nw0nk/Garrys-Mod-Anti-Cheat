# Garrys-Mod-Anti-Cheat

A Simple Anti Cheat

This Anti Cheat is how I like to deal with people and prevent them doing things or bypassing ingame functions with external programs or exploits.

It is still in development but I will list below what methods are finished and what I am still working on.

For a decent Anti wallhack method just put into your servers launch command line "+sv_pure 1"

# Finished Features :

Anti-Bhop (Bunny Hopping.)

Anti-CVAR-Manipulation (Prevent players changing console variables allowing them to inject their cheats.)

Anti-SpeedHacking (Prevent players going beyond their max velocity.)

Anti-Recoil (Forces players to look up or down when shooting if their weapon has a recoil method attached.)

# Under development :

https://github.com/C0nw0nk/Garrys-Mod-Anti-Cheat/blob/master/garrysmod/lua/autorun/server/send-lua-and-net-send.lua

If you choose to allow players to run "sv_allowcslua 1" then we need to prevent them exploiting or having unfair advantages over other players.
